# üß† AI Projects: NLP & Computer Vision

This repository is a curated collection of **end-to-end AI projects** spanning **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Multi-Modal AI**. Each project is implemented in a **self-contained Jupyter Notebook** (or script) with explanations, code, and results.

The repo is structured to demonstrate both **breadth of exploration** and **depth of implementation**, making it suitable as both a **learning hub** and a **portfolio showcase**.
